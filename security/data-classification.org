* Data classification
** Methodology

- Data classification :: Data classification *categorizes* business information
  based on the *value* of information and a *negative impact* of unauthorized
  disclosure, modification, or deletion of business information
- Data classification levels :: The data classification levels are used to
  identify *security risks* threatening business information at each security
  level, and designate appropriate *protection mechanisms* that effectively
  mitigate identified security risks

*** Security risks

- Security risks ::
  - dis :: Unauthorized disclosure (confidentiality)
  - mod :: Unauthorized modification (integrity)
  - del :: Unauthorized deletion (availability)
  - rep :: Repudiation of actions (audit trail)

*** Protection mechanisms

- Protection mechanisms ::
  - aun :: Strong authentication e.g. MFA
  - auz :: Fine-grained authorization e.g. RBAC, ABAC, PBAC
  - aud :: Audit trail
  - mon :: Security monitoring
  - enc :: Data encryption

** Data classification levels
*** Public data

- Public data :: Unauthorized disclosure of public data does not have a negative
  impact on customers or a company
  - Producers and consumers
    - Producers: =aun= and =auz= employees
    - Consumers: unauthenticated leads, customers, employees
  - Security risks: =mod=, =del=, =rep=
  - Protection mechanisms
    - Read: none (public access)
    - Write: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=
  - Examples: public marketing material, application usage instructions,
    customer support material

*** Internal data

- Internal data :: Unauthorized disclosure of internal data may benefit
  competitors
  - Producers and consumers
    - Producers: =aun= and =auz= employees
    - Consumers: =aun= customers, =aun= employees
  - Security risks: =dis=, =mod=, =del=, =rep=
  - Protection mechanisms
    - Read: =aun=
    - Write: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=
  - Examples: internal policies, internal procedures, training material

*** Confidential data

- Confidential data :: Unauthorized disclosure of confidential data negatively
  impacts customer trust and leads to financial loss, legal penalties,
  reputational damage for a company
  - Producers and consumers
    - Producers: =aun= and =auz= customers, =aun= and =auz= employees
    - Consumers: =aun= and =auz= customers, =aun= and =auz= employees
  - Security risks: =dis=, =mod=, =del=, =rep=
  - Protection mechanisms
    - Read: =aun=, =auz=, =enc=
    - Write: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=, =mon=, =enc=
  - Examples: personal identifiable information PII, protected health
    information PHI, legal documents, pricing information, financial
    information, payment information

*** Restricted data

- Restricted data :: Unauthorized disclosure of restricted data severely impacts
  financial stability of a company and threatens legal existence of a company
  - Producers and consumers
    - Producers: =aun= and =auz= employees
    - Consumers: =aun= and =auz= employees
  - Security risks: =dis=, =mod=, =del=, =rep=
  - Protection mechanisms
    - Read: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=, =mon=, =enc=
    - Write: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=, =mon=, =enc=
  - Examples: trade secrets, patents, strategic business plans, strategic
    partnership agreements

*** Archived data

- Archived data :: Archived data is no longer actively used, but must be
  securely stored for legal and regulatory reasons
  - Producers and consumers
    - Producers: system processes for automatic data archiving
    - Consumers: =aun= and =auz= employees
  - Security risks: =dis=, =mod=, =del=, =rep=
  - Protection mechanisms
    - Read: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=, =mon=, =enc=
    - Write: =aun=, =auz=, =aud=, =mon=, =enc=
  - Examples: deactivated customer accounts, old financial reports
