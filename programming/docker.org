* Docker

- Container :: (OS-level virtualization) an isolated and portable environment to
  package and efficiently run programs. Containers run both cloud-native
  applications and serverless functions
  - Isolation :: each container has its own hostname, IP, and disk.
  - Density :: all containers share a host OS, CPU, and memory
  - Network :: containers can be connected to a virtual network
- Dockerfile :: specifies a packaging procedure to build an image for a single
  program
- Image :: a layered packaging format for building a container file system.
  Read-only image layers are shared between different images to save storage
  space. Every instruction in a Dockerfile creates an image layer that is reused
  from a cache to reduce build time on subsequent builds if the instruction and
  previous layers have not changed. Place instructions that are more likely to
  change at the bottom of a Dockerfile
- Docker Compose file :: specifies a deployment procedure for a system
