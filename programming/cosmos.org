* Cosmos SDK

- Cosmos SDK :: a modular framework for building from scratch
  application-specific multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake PoS and permissioned
  Proof-of-Authority PoA custom blockchains that interoperate with other
  blockchains
- CometBFT :: a BFT consensus engine for building PoS
- Application-specific blockchain :: a blockchain customized to operate a single
  application vs limited competing smarty contracts in Solidity DSL interpreted
  on a shared EVM virtual machine. CometBFT provides networking and consensus,
  while Cosmos SDK provides an application state machine. A Cosmos SDK state
  machine is connected to a pluggable CometBFT consensus engine through an
  Application Blockchain Interface ABCI that can be wrapped by any programming
  language to develop a state machine using different designs e.g. validation,
  storage and libraries e.g. cryptography
- Sovereignty :: application developers have full control over both an
  application-specific blockchain and an application state machine
